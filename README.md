2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or other package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (commands in these post will presume a Yarn installation)
3. Clone or download this repository from https://github.com/Kaisaurus/FSND_P05F
4. Install all dependencies by running the following command in the terminal in the project folder
```
yarn install // or npm install
```
5. Run the site on localhost by running the following command in the terminal
